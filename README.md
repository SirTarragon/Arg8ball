# Arg8ball
While this is also a template for discord bots, this is the main code for arg8ball, a simple magic 8-ball bot with some minor added features. This was made to fulfill this season of Conqueror's Blade and our House's decision to follow the whims of Lady Luck in our decision-making. 

## Commands

* `flip` - flips a coin, heads or tails.
* `roll #d#` - rolls a dice, first \# decides how many rolls, second one decides max number on dice
* `ask __` - asks the magic 8-ball whatever follows after ask command
* `cardinal` - gives a random cardinal direction
